# E-commerce-Back-End-Challenge

## Description

This project was completed for the Object Relational Mapping module of the UT/EdX programming bootcamp. The goal of the project was to use the ORM technology Sequelize to complete the provided starter code backend of mock e-commerce site. Completing the code offered the opportunity to practice the concepts of creating models and associations for a MySQL database using Sequelize, as well as to practice creating GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE routes. Additionally, running the application provided experience with API testing using Insomnia, as well as the use of environment variables to secure credentials.


## Installation

The application can be run locally as long as the user has MySQL installed. Download the repository code to run the application according to the directions in the 'usage' section below.


## Usage

From the command line, run the command npm install to install all the required node dependencies. Then login to MySQL bash in the terminal. From there, run SOURCE db/schema.sql to setup the SQL database. run 'quit' to exit MySQL and return to the default bash command line. Use the command 'npm run seed' to seed the database with the seed placeholder data. After that, run 'node server' or 'npm run start' to start the server running locally on the specified port. From there, the localhost URL routes can be tested/used to manipulate the database either with an API testing software like Insomnia or in a web browser.
